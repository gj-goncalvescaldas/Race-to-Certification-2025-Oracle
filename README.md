## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

After a long medical recovery from an accident and several surgeries, I'm transitioning back into the workforce. While I already have experience with **Microsoft Azure**, I'm taking advantage of Oracle's free certification initiative to deepen my cloud expertise.

Although OCI isn't the most in-demand cloud platform, the foundational principles apply across all major providers. Once I complete the OCI tracks, I plan to pursue **Azure certifications** as well.

This repo not only tracks my learning but also serves as a **study guide** for others who may find themselves on a similar path.
