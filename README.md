## üìÇ Lesson Notes

### OCI Introduction ‚Üí Class: **OCI Architecture**

#### üß± OCI Physical Architecture

**Key Concepts:**

- **Region:** A localized geographic area that contains one or more *Availability Domains (ADs)*.  
  Choose based on:
  - Proximity to users (low latency)
  - Data residency/compliance
  - Service availability

- **Availability Domain (AD):**  
  Independent, fault-tolerant data centers within a region.  
  - Do **not share** power, cooling, or network
  - A region typically has 3 ADs

- **Fault Domain (FD):**  
  Logical groupings of hardware within an AD  
  - Each AD contains 3 FDs  
  - Help avoid single points of failure  
  - Only one FD is actively updated at a time

#### üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Distribute resources across multiple FDs and ADs
- Use Oracle Data Guard to replicate and sync databases
- Even in single-AD regions, use FDs for redundancy

#### ‚úÖ Summary

- **Region ‚Üí Availability Domains ‚Üí Fault Domains**
- Use these constructs to build **highly available**, **resilient** architectures

## üß™ Skill Check: OCI Introduction

This section summarizes the questions and correct answers for the Skill Check quiz in Module 2.

---

### **1. Which statement about regions and availability domains is true?**

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**An OCI region has one or more availability domains.**

**Explanation:**  
Each region is a localized geographic area with one or more ADs. Fault domains provide protection **within** an AD, not across regions.

---

### **2. Which capability can be used to protect against failures within an OCI availability domain?**

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**Fault Domain**

**Explanation:**  
Fault Domains isolate hardware within a single AD. Distributing resources across FDs reduces the impact of failures within that AD.

---

### **3. Which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service is NOT intended for a multicloud solution?**

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**Oracle Roving Edge Infrastructure**

**Explanation:**  
This is used for **edge computing** in remote environments, not for multicloud.  
Multicloud services include:
- Oracle Database Service for Azure  
- Oracle Interconnect for Azure  
- Oracle MySQL HeatWave on AWS

---

### **4. Which statement about OCI is NOT true?**

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**A single fault domain can be associated with multiple availability domains within a region.**

**Explanation:**  
Fault Domains are scoped to a **single AD**. They do not span ADs.

---

### **5. You have subscribed to an OCI region with one availability domain. You want to deploy a highly available application with two servers and a 2-node database. How would you place the components?**

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**Place one server and a DB node in one fault domain, and the second server and DB node in another fault domain.**

**Explanation:**  
When limited to one AD, the best way to increase availability is to **spread components across multiple fault domains** within that AD.
