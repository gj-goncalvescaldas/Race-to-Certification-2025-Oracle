    - **Multi-Class Classification:** Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral)

#### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Training with Labeled Data:**  
  - The model is trained using a dataset that includes both features (e.g., hours studied) and known outcomes (e.g., pass/fail).
  - After training, the model can classify new, unseen data based on learned patterns.

#### üìä Logistic Regression for Classification

- **Key Concept:**  
  Logistic regression is used to predict **binary outcomes** (e.g., pass/fail) and can be extended to **multi-class problems**.

- **Model Mechanics:**
  - Input: One or more numeric features (e.g., hours of study).
  - Output: Probability between **0 and 1** using the **sigmoid function**.
  - Prediction rule:
    - If probability > 0.5 ‚Üí **Class A** (e.g., "pass")
    - If probability < 0.5 ‚Üí **Class B** (e.g., "fail")

- **Sigmoid Function:**  
  \[
  \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
  \]  
  Maps any real value to [0, 1] for interpreting outputs as probabilities.

  - **Stock Prediction:** Inputs ‚Üí financial indicators ‚Üí Output ‚Üí price

#### üîÑ Supervised Learning Process

- **Training:**  
  The model is trained on a dataset of **input-output pairs** (e.g., house size ‚Üí price).
  
- **Goal:**  
  Learn a **mapping function** that minimizes prediction error on new data.

#### üìâ Linear Regression Explained

- **Use Case:**  
  Predicting house prices using house size (in sq. ft.).

- **Model Equation:**  
  \[
  f(x) = w \cdot x + b
  \]  
  - **x** = input (e.g., size)  
  - **w** = slope (rate of price increase)  
  - **b** = bias/intercept (price offset)

- **Model Training:**
  - Input and output data are visualized as a **scatter plot**.
  - A **line of best fit** is found using **slope and bias** adjustments.
  - The model aims to **minimize loss**, defined as the difference between predicted and actual prices.

#### ‚ùó Key Concepts

- **Error:** Difference between predicted and true values.
- **Loss Function:** Often the **squared error**:
  \[
  \text{Loss} = (y_{\text{pred}} - y_{\text{actual}})^2
  \]
- **Optimization:** Algorithm iteratively adjusts **w** and **b** to minimize loss.

#### üîÅ Inference & Prediction

- Once trained, the model can:
  - Accept **new input** (e.g., 1,100 sq. ft.)
  - Use the learned function to **predict** a price.

#### üîë Final Takeaway

Regression is used when the prediction target is **numeric**. Linear regression builds a straight-line model that maps inputs to outputs using learned weights and biases. It's a foundational technique in supervised learning, crucial for tasks like **forecasting, pricing, and risk modeling**.

As core enablers of **Generative AI**, they are revolutionizing natural language understanding and interaction across virtually every domain.

#### Transformers Part-1  
---

#### üìù Summary:
This lesson introduces the **Transformer architecture**, a revolutionary deep learning model that overcomes the limitations of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for language understanding. It explains how Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously using a **self-attention mechanism**, enabling them to understand long-range dependencies and contextual meaning in text.

#### üß† Challenges with Traditional RNNs

- RNNs process input **sequentially**, maintaining a **hidden state** at each step.
- Suitable for short sequences, but **struggle with long-range dependencies**.
- Context degrades over time ‚Üí suffers from **vanishing gradients**.
- Example issue: Difficulty understanding pronoun references like ‚Äúit‚Äù in long sentences.

#### üß© How Transformers Solve These Issues

- Transformers process **all tokens simultaneously**, not sequentially.
- They have a **global view** of the entire sequence at once.
- Capable of understanding **relationships between distant words** in a sentence.

#### üß† Self-Attention Mechanism

- Allows the model to **"pay attention"** to relevant words in the input, regardless of position.
- Adds **contextual understanding** by weighing the importance of other tokens.
- Example:
  - In ‚ÄúJane threw the frisbee and her dog fetched it,‚Äù  
    self-attention helps the model infer that ‚Äúit‚Äù refers to ‚Äúfrisbee.‚Äù
- Enables accurate understanding of **pronouns, dependencies, and sequence meaning**.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Transformer Architecture Overview

| Component     | Function                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encoder**   | Converts input into **context-rich vector representations**              |
| **Decoder**   | Uses encoded vectors to **generate output text**                         |
| **Self-Attention** | Core mechanism enabling **contextual relevance between all tokens** |
| **Parallel Processing** | Allows much faster training and inference vs. RNNs             |

- Introduced in the paper: **"Attention Is All You Need"** (2017).
- Transformer is the foundation for LLMs like GPT, BERT, and others.

#### üîÅ Encoder-Decoder Structure

- **Encoder**:  
  Processes the input sentence and extracts **contextual embeddings**.
- **Decoder**:  
  Generates a response or prediction based on encoded information.
- Both components contain **multiple layers** connected via self-attention.

#### üîë Final Takeaway

Transformers revolutionized NLP by introducing **self-attention**, enabling models to understand full sequences in context‚Äîregardless of word distance. Unlike RNNs, they don‚Äôt process one word at a time, but analyze entire inputs at once, making them the core of today‚Äôs most powerful language models.

#### Transformers Part-2  
---

#### üìù Summary:
This lesson expands on the **Transformer architecture**, explaining the roles of **tokenization**, **embeddings**, and the differences between **encoder-only**, **decoder-only**, and **encoder-decoder** models. It also introduces practical applications such as **semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, showing how vector-based understanding enables powerful AI workflows.

#### üî§ Tokens and Tokenization

- **Tokens** are the basic units understood by LLMs:  
  - Can be full words (e.g., *apple*)  
  - Word parts (e.g., *friend-ship*)  
  - Or punctuation marks (e.g., *,* or *.*)
- Average:
  - **1 token per word** for simple text  
  - **2‚Äì3 tokens per word** for complex/uncommon vocabulary

#### üìä What Are Embeddings?

#### Prompt Engineering  
--- 

#### üìù Summary:
This lesson explains how **prompts** guide Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces the concept of **prompt engineering**‚Äîcrafting inputs to obtain desired outputs. It covers techniques like **instruction tuning**, **in-context learning**, **k-shot prompting**, and **chain-of-thought prompting**, along with a major challenge known as **hallucination**.

#### üßæ What Is a Prompt?

- A **prompt** is the input or text given to an LLM to generate a response.
- LLMs are trained to **complete text** by predicting the next likely token.
- Example: ‚ÄúFour score and seven years ago...‚Äù ‚Üí LLM predicts the rest.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Prompt Engineering

- **Prompt engineering** is the process of iteratively refining prompts to elicit useful or specific responses from LLMs.
- It's challenging because traditional LLMs are **completion-based**, not instruction-following.

#### üß™ Instruction Tuning & RLHF

- **Instruction Tuning:** Fine-tuning LLMs on datasets with instructions and expected responses.
  - Example: Llama 2 Chat was fine-tuned on **28,000 prompt-response pairs**.
- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):**
  - Human annotators evaluate model outputs.
  - Their preferences train a **reward model** that helps align model behavior with human expectations.

#### üìå Prompt Engineering Techniques

1. ### üß† In-Context Learning & k-Shot Prompting

| Type         | Description                                          | Example                         |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **0-shot**   | No example provided                                  | Translate ‚Äúcheese‚Äù to French.   |
| **1-shot**   | One example provided                                 | English ‚Üí French: ‚Äúapple‚Äù = ‚Äúpomme‚Äù |
| **k-shot**   | k examples shown before asking the model to complete | 3 examples of translation shown |

- Helps condition the model on how to respond **without changing its parameters**.

2. ### üîó Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- Encourages the model to **reason step-by-step**, mimicking human problem-solving.
- Effective for **complex tasks** that require logic, math, or sequential reasoning.
- Instead of giving just the answer, the model is prompted to explain its reasoning process.

**Example Prompt:**
> Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.  
> He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls.  
> Each can has 3 balls.  
> How many tennis balls does he have now?

**Model Response (Chain-of-Thought):**
> Starts with 5.  
> 2 cans √ó 3 balls = 6.  
> 5 + 6 = 11.  
> **Answer: 11**

Another example:

> The cafeteria had 20 bananas.  
> They used 10 for pancakes.  
> Then purchased 8 more.  
> How many bananas now?

**Model Response (Chain-of-Thought):**
> 20 - 10 = 10.  
> 10 + 8 = 18.  
> **Answer: 18**

- Without chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs may produce incorrect answers.
- This technique improves **accuracy** and **transparency** in reasoning.

#### üö® Hallucination in LLMs

- **Hallucination** occurs when a model generates content that is **not factually correct** or **not grounded in real data**.
- It may look fluent and confident, making it harder to detect.
- Example of hallucination:
  > "In the U.S., people gradually adopted the practice of driving on the left side."
  - ‚ùå Factually incorrect ‚Äì U.S. drives on the **right** side.

- Hallucinations can be:
  - **Obvious** ‚Äì easily identifiable.
  - **Subtle** ‚Äì sound plausible but are false.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigating Hallucinations

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** reduces hallucination by:
  - Fetching relevant documents from external sources.
  - Grounding responses in **real, verifiable information**.

- Current LLMs:
  - Still hallucinate occasionally.
  - Researchers are developing methods to **measure groundedness**.
  - No definitive solution exists yet, but progress is ongoing.

#### üîë Final Takeaway

Prompt engineering is a **crucial skill** for getting reliable and useful outputs from LLMs.  
Key techniques:
- **In-context learning & k-shot prompting**: Guide LLMs with examples.
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Improve reasoning accuracy.
- **Instruction tuning & RLHF**: Align model behavior with human expectations.

Despite advances, **hallucination remains a key challenge**, and emerging solutions like **RAG** are vital to improve LLM reliability.

#### Customize LLMs with your data  
---

### üìä Overview

To effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to your specific needs, consider a framework based on two axes:

- **Horizontal axis: Context Optimization**
  - Inject user- or domain-specific data during inference.
  - Example: Recent orders made on a website.

- **Vertical axis: LLM Optimization**

## 4. üß≠ Choosing the Right Method

| Method               | When to Use                                                 | Pros                                                  | Cons                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | When the model already knows the topic                      | Simple, fast, no cost                                  | Limited control                        |
| **RAG**               | When data changes often or hallucinations are a concern     | Dynamic, grounded in current data                     | Needs a compatible, high-quality data source |
| **Fine-Tuning**       | When model fails at specific tasks or needs domain adaptation | Highly accurate and efficient for tailored tasks       | Expensive, complex, needs labeled data |

## 5. üîÅ Iterative Customization Framework

### üöÄ A Practical Journey

1. **Start with prompt engineering**
   - Set a baseline using few-shot examples.
2. **Add RAG** if prompts are insufficient
   - Connect to enterprise knowledge bases.
3. **Fine-tune** the RAG-enhanced model
   - Optimize output format, tone, or performance.
4. **Optimize further**
   - Improve retrieval and data quality.
   - Repeat fine-tuning as necessary.

You may end up combining all three strategies for best results.

## üîë Final Takeaway

To customize an LLM for your data and tasks, use a **layered approach**:

- Start with **prompt engineering**.
- Add **retrieval-augmented generation** to ground responses.
- Apply **fine-tuning** for deep domain adaptation.

Each method builds upon the previous one, offering increasing levels of **control, accuracy, and complexity**.

#### Skill Check: Gen AI Basics  
---

### 1. What aspect of Large Language Models significantly impacts their capabilities, performance, and resource requirements?
